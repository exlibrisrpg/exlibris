# Ex Libris

A database of MÃ¶rk Borg content. For [Liber Ludorum].

## Dependencies

- Ruby 2.7.2
- Yarn
- Postgres 13
- Redis

For advice on setting up these dependencies, please see the
[wiki](https://github.com/exlibrisrpg/exlibris/wiki#setting-up-dependencies).

## Setup

To get this running locally run `bin/setup`. You can also use the `-f` flag to
generate the test fixtures in the development database (helpful for local test
content).

```
$ bin/setup -h
Setup Ex Libris' dependencies and database

Usage: bin/ci [options]
    -f, --with-fixtures              Load fixtures into database
    -h, --help                       Prints this help message
```

## Running locally

Start up the server with `bin/rails server`.

### Subdomains on localhost

Ex Libris RPG supports multiple systems on different subdomains. The simplest
way to manage this locally is with [puma-dev](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev).
This will run the application for you, and you can access it on
`exlibrisrpg.test` or any subdomain like `mork-borg.exlibrisrpg.test`.

```
puma-dev link -n exlibrisrpg
```

## Testing

Unit tests, system tests, security checks and linting are all packaged into
`bin/ci`. This is the set of tests and checks which are run by the CI pipeline
on GitHub.
