# Ex Libris

A database of MÃ¶rk Borg content. For [Liber Ludorum].

[Liber Ludorum]: https://liberludorum.com/2020/09/28/ex-libris-mork-borg/

## Dependencies

- Ruby 2.7.2
- Yarn
- Postgres 14.2

### Run dependencies with Docker Compose

A [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file is included in the repo to run
dependencies locally. At the moment, this is just Postgres 14.2.

The connection details for the Docker Compose dependencies are defined in
[`.env.sample`](.env.sample) so copy this file to `.env` and use a tool like
[direnv](https://direnv.net) to setup the environment variables.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env # Make a local copy of the example environment variables
direnv allow        # Tell direnv we trust this .env file
docker compose up   # Start the dependencies
bin/setup -f        # Setup script with test data
rails server        # Run the project
```

## Setup

To get this running locally run `bin/setup`. You can also use the `-f` flag to
generate the test fixtures in the development database (helpful for local test
content).

```
$ bin/setup -h
Setup Ex Libris' dependencies and database

Usage: bin/ci [options]
    -f, --with-fixtures              Load fixtures into database
    -h, --help                       Prints this help message
```

## Running locally

Start up the server with `bin/rails server`.

### Subdomains on localhost

Ex Libris RPG supports multiple systems on different subdomains. The simplest
way to manage this locally is with [puma-dev](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev).
This will run the application for you, and you can access it on
`exlibrisrpg.test` or any subdomain like `mork-borg.exlibrisrpg.test`.

```
puma-dev link -n exlibrisrpg
```

## Testing

Unit tests, system tests, security checks and linting are all packaged into
`bin/ci`. This is the set of tests and checks which are run by the CI pipeline
on GitHub.

## Theming and components

A fairly simple theming system is being introduced to allow presenting different
systems with different designs and layouts. This will mostly be based on [CSS
custom properties] and [Rails variants].

To make the process easier, components are being extracted with [ViewComponent]
so that they can be inspected in isolation with [Lookbook]. You can access
Lookbook when running the application in development at `/lookbook`. When
theming for each system is implemented, you will be able to use the appropriate
subdomain to view the component library for that particular system:

```
mork-borg.exlibrisrpg.test/lookbook
mausritter.exlibrisrpg.test/lookbook
```
