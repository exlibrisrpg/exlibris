# Ex Libris

A database of MÃ¶rk Borg content. For [Liber Ludorum].

## Setup

To get this running locally run `bin/setup`. You can also use the `-f` flag to
generate the test fixtures in the development database (helpful for local test
content).

```
$ bin/setup -h
Setup Ex Libris' dependencies and database

Usage: bin/ci [options]
    -f, --with-fixtures              Load fixtures into database
    -h, --help                       Prints this help message
```

## Testing

Unit tests, system tests, security checks and linting are all packaged into
`bin/ci`. This is the set of tests and checks which are run by the CI pipeline
on GitHub.
